## About @colibri

This project is built with [@colibri](https://github.com/fazzatti/colibri), a TypeScript-first toolkit for building robust Stellar and Soroban applications. Colibri provides deterministic error handling, composable transaction pipelines, and an extensible plugin architecture. Key packages include [@colibri/core](https://jsr.io/@colibri/core) for transaction orchestration and event parsing, and [@colibri/event-streamer](https://jsr.io/@colibri/event-streamer) for real-time and historical Soroban event ingestion.
